SurveyJS Form Library is a free and open-source MIT-licensed JavaScript form builder library that allows you to design dynamic, data-driven, multi-language survey forms and run them in your web applications.

> - [Add Survey Creator to an Angular v8&ndash;v11 Application](https://github.com/surveyjs/code-examples/tree/main/legacy-angular/survey-creator)
