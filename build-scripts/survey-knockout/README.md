SurveyJS Form Library is a free and open-source MIT-licensed JavaScript form builder library that allows you to design dynamic, data-driven, multi-language survey forms and run them in your web applications.

> **NOTE**: This package contains a legacy version of SurveyJS Form Library for Knockout. We recommend using a [new implementation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/survey-react-ui) that separates the data model from the UI rendering. For information on how to integrate it into your application, refer to the following tutorial: [Add a Survey to a Knockout Application](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/get-started-knockout).
