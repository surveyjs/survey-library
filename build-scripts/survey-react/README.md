SurveyJS Form Library is a free and open-source MIT-licensed JavaScript form builder library that allows you to design dynamic, data-driven, multi-language survey forms and run them in your web applications.

> **NOTE**: This package contains a legacy Knockout-dependent version of SurveyJS Form Library for React. We recommend using a new [native implementation of SurveyJS React Form Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/survey-react-ui). For information on how to integrate it into your application, refer to the following tutorial: [Add a Survey to a React Application](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/get-started-react).
