# SurveyJS Form Library for Vue (OBSOLETE)

SurveyJS Form Library is a free and open-source MIT-licensed JavaScript form builder library that allows you to design dynamic, data-driven, multi-language survey forms and run them in your web applications.

> **NOTE**: This package contains an obsolete, Knockout-powered version of SurveyJS Form Library for Vue. We recommend using a new [native implementation of SurveyJS Vue Form Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/survey-vue-ui). For information on how to integrate it into your application, refer to the following tutorial: [Add a Survey to a Vue Application](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/get-started-vue).
