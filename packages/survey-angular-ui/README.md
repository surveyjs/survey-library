A free and open-source MIT-licensed JavaScript form builder library that allows you to design dynamic, data-driven, multi-language survey forms and run them in your Angular applications.

> **NOTE**: SurveyJS for Angular requires Angular v12.0.0 or newer and depends on the `@angular/cdk` package. If your project does not include it yet, run the following command:
>
> ```cmd
> npm install @angular/cdk@^12.0.0 --save
> ```
>
> Earlier Angular versions are supported by the [`survey-angular`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/survey-angular) package. It depends on Knockout and is now obsolete. However, you can use it in your Angular v8&ndash;v11 projects. Refer to the following examples on GitHub for more information:
